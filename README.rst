Developers
==========

Deployment is via gh-pages but you need to have "built" the app using brunch
first. To make changes and deploy you do:

1. Edit stuff in master branch and commit
2. Check out gh-pages
3. Run `brunch build`
4. Copy contents of new public folder to root directory
5. Commit and deploy ...
