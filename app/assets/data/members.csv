"agatalotauro","Description/ About me","Résumé \
\
	This  resumè is intended to introduce myself and explore your potential need for someone with my unusual blend of qualifications (collaborations).\
 \
	Beginning my academic career at the University of Palermo, School of Architecture, I graduated in 1993 (gaining the highest distinction) and was able to gain valuable cultural experience under the Erasmus Exchange Programme 1992-93 (coordinated by Full. Prof. R. La Franca and tutored by Full Prof. N. Teymur and Jhon Archer).  The result of my final theses was published in Progetto di Laurea 1993.\
After moving to England I held several positions with the Simpson Associates Architects and The Pickard Filanson Partnership, BBC Project Office (New Broad casting House, Manchester) under the COMET Programme.  In these positions I had the indispensable advantage of gaining valuable computer experiences, professional skills, and management knowledge. \
\
	Being employed as Research Assistance by the University of Manchester, School of Architecture and Town Planning (under the MPhil Course), I was able to refine my human relations, leadership and cultural expertise.  Responsible for the International Post Graduate Group, providing supply and academic supports for cultural exchange programme, I was required to utilise all my previous expertise and knowledge. I also attended two Master Courses (II level) at the “Scuola Superiore”, Catania University (coordinated by Full Prof. Giarrizzo, Aymard, De Carlo and I. Rizzo). Part of her research was also conducted at the Innovation Relay Centre (http://www.innovationrelay.net/, Catania University) API Industrie and Consorzio Catania Ricerche. I worked for the ESE (European School of Economics - Communication &amp; Media Studies) as a Visual Communication &amp; Computer graphics lecturer (a.a. 2001-2). I participated in several European Research and Educational Programmes providing supply and academic supports for cultural exchange programmes. I attended the Ph.D Course in “Geomatics and Territorial Information Systems” (supervisor and coordinator Full Prof. G. Manzoni, Trieste University) from 2004 to 2007. \
\
I successfully completed the Teaching with WebTycho Training Session \\\"CTLA201\\\" - UMUC\\'s Center for Teaching and Learning - University of Maryland University College – Instructor Prof. Deb Hullet, May-June 2009. I was “Direttore Tecnico dei Lavori, Progettista e Collaudatore” of Sicilian Curie Arcivescovili under Sicilian POR Programmes, tasked with developing new business and achieving ambitious growth plans within Sicilian SMEs and Local Institutions. I collaborate with several Research Centres and International Institutions (e.g. http://www.supinfo.it, http://www.sdasr.unict.it/,http://www.csyfes.it/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=71, http://cnic.navy.mil./sigonella, etc.). I am “Professore a contratto” (http://www.sdasr.unict.it/personale/personale_docente.php &amp; http://www.supinfo.it). \
I am attending a Master Course (II level – topic “Leadership and Educational Institution”, a.a. 2010-2011).\
I have more than 18 years’ experience in designing workflow process in the field of Geomatics for Cultural and Natural Heritage. I win public competitions I have applied for (idoneità), to work for Italian Public Institutions.\
I have also worked as Professor for IPSIA Giarre -Majorana-Sabin\\'s Center for Professional Teaching (Minister of Public Instruction, University and Research, since 2000) and Liceo Scientifico, Galileo Galilei - Catania (since 2010). Thesis, papers and scientific works have been published in National and International Cultural Events, Magazine and Journals since 1993 (topic – Geomatics).

	Additionally, I have the ability to adapt to new situations without hindrance to normal operating procedures.  I am a strong decision maker and problem solver.  My strengths include:  Excellent communication skills with the ability to interact with individuals at all levels to ensure smooth operations; superb cultural evaluations, solid motivational techniques that inspire a desire in personnel to maximize productivity, and increase innovations. \
	I consider that my dedication to long range objectives and the ability to implement results will provide the basis of increased growth and profitability for your institution.

She has an MSc in The Evolution of Language and Cognition from the University of Edinburgh and a BA in English Language and Linguistics form the University of York. Her favourite language is Hungarian. She self identifies as a ‘geek’, not only in the modern sense of the word: “One who is perceived to be overly obsessed with one or more things including those of intellectuality”, but also the former meaning of: “A carnival performer often billed as a wild man whose act usually includes biting the head off a live chicken, bat, snake or bugs.” (She’s a vegetarian really)."
